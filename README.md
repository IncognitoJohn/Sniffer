## WIP ##

##### Short overview #####
1. Sub-Ghz, EMF, 2.4Ghz, NFC, Ir, badusb, ect.
2. woah? must be a dream- and is... FOR NOW! 
(This gonna take 15 million decades to finish alone- if you wanna help develop msg me on discord (.snifi))
4. Gonna be diy friendly!! :D
5. cheap if lazy to make (hopefully)
6. sum moor stuff
7. (im way more of a hardware guy so, expect to see hardware stuff first)
