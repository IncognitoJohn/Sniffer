## WIP ##

##### Short overview #####
1. Ctrl C sub ghz and 2.ghz + nfc + ir + badusb ect.
2. Ctrl V to SD card for later repeating-
3. packet monitor and more???? 
4. woah? must be a dream- and is... FOR NOW! 
(This gonna take 15 million decades to finish alone- if you wanna help develop msg me on discord (Snifi#4084))
5. Star and wait!
-
6. Gonna be diy friendly!! :D
7. cheap if lazy to make
8. good alternative to flipper 0 (and way cheaper)
9. sum moor stuff
10. (im way more of a hardware guy so, expect to see hardware stuff first)
11. ps:yall think ill give out the code jus like that? thats like givin' a baby a gun
